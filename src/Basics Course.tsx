            <Video videoString={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6oCUlW0YEiA?si=VCjb91NyGuHBysU_"} videoTranscript={"In this video, we're going to go through the basic items that I think every kitchen needs to have, and a lot of these are going to be required for the recipes in the tool or the website that you're viewing today. So we're going to break it into two separate categories. We're going to have cooking utensils, which are going to be things that we use to prepare and get ingredients ready, and then we're going to have the actual cooking materials that we're going to use to cook on the stovetop or in the oven. So first we're going to go through these looking utensils, and I'll walk through each one a little bit about what it's good for and why you should have one. So starting from the front up here we have a cutting board and almost every time you have a recipe you're going to want to cut something whether it be an onion or anything like that so I always recommend a high quality cutting board so you're not just cutting on a plate or on a countertop. And then the knives that you're going to want to have. I have two main ones that I find myself using a lot. So I have my chef's knife which just is used in things like cutting chicken or other bigger items like cutting an onion and this will be good because you can get a lot of leverage and a lot of power when you want to go use the knife. So it's good for those bigger things or those tougher ingredients. And then we're also going to have a paring knife which is a lot smaller. It's good for things like peeling or cutting smaller objects that you're going to not quite need a chefs knife for and you just want them to be a little easier to manage. The other item that I have on my cutting board is going to be a thermometer. I always like to have a thermometer because when you cook meat it's very important that you cook it to the right temperature to make sure that it's safe to eat, So, I'll have those temperatures in my recipes but you can always look them up, and it's always good to have a meat thermometer on hand. Moving on to things that we're going to be measuring with, I have a couple with me here so I have a glass measuring cup that we're going to use for liquid ingredients. And I like the glass ones because when you fill it up you can see right through. You can really be sure you're getting the measurements right. You don't have to guess. For more solid ingredients, I have these measuring cups. I have a cup, a half, a third, and a fourth. They normally come in a set, but you're going to use this for your dry ingredients, and you're going to make sure that you're measuring them properly. A lot of times recipes will specify don't use your liquid measuring cup for dry ingredients so it's always good to have both on hand. And then if you have something that's a little bit smaller, you can use those bigger measurements for most stores will sell sets that have half teaspoon, teaspoon, half tablespoon, and tablespoon. And these will really help you get those smaller things. Not pictured, I also have a scale. A lot of the time some recipes will actually show you the grams or the ounces of something that you want to use, so kitchen scale is helpful, but not always necessary. Now for the items that we're going to be using a little bit more prep for, we have a cheese grater and this grater has a couple sides so it's pretty multi-purpose. It's got a side for slicing, it's got a side for bigger grating, and smaller grating, so this is really helpful when you need to shred your own cheese, maybe shred an apple, or anything that you could need shredded. We also have tools that we're going to be mixing with or flipping with. So I'll go through these. I always like to have a whisk. This will be when you want something incorporated really well. It's used a lot in baking, and it's pretty helpful so you want to make sure you grab one. With a spatula a lot of them will come in two pieces, I always like the ones that are just one single piece because they're easier to clean. This one's rubber which always makes it an extra step that's easier to clean. And this is good for mixing things or sautéing things. We also have this flipper also can be called a spatula, and this is what you'll use in your pots and on your sheets to flip your thing to flip the item that you're cooking, and they're heat resistant so it's okay if your pan's still hot. But sometimes it's easier to use spatula than just try to use a fork and flip your item. I also have this wooden spoon I use this a lot for stirring when things are on the stove like pasta or maybe sautéing things. So just another helpful thing that you can have if you need to stir a lot of things at once. So now we're going to move on to what we actually use in the cooking process or in the baking process. So we're going to start with things that go on the stove top. I've got two frying pans here. I always like to have two. I have a smaller one and a larger one. If I'm just cooking for myself, more often than not I'll use the smaller one, but when I have company I tend to need the bigger one just to make sure that I am able to cook enough food for everybody. The other two things that are going to go on the stove are going to be your pots. I have a little sauce pot here. It's not too big; it's good for single serve things when I'm cooking for myself. I'll tend to use this one. Then I also have this large sauce pot. So this is great if you want to cook a pound or two of pasta you want to make a large pot of sauce, and cook and prep for the week, it's always nice to have a larger one when you're cooking for more than just one meal. For the items that are going to go in the oven, I also have a couple out here. Start with the most personal one, and this is going to be your pie pan. So if you watch the breaded chicken recipe you'll see that I actually use pie pans for my breading stations, and I actually use it for each step of the chicken. So these are really good for part of your prepping process and if you just want to have another thing to mix in. Pie plates going to be great for you can also make pies in it which is always a fun time. The other two things that I'm going to talk about are going to be the 9x13 glass pan. And I specify glass because once you get to the point where you're comfortable enough to go and look at online recipes, a lot of them won't specify which kind of 9x13 to use, and they come in glass ceramic, and a couple of other materials. So if you use a ceramic your cook times are going to be longer and you might get a little frustrated that the recipe is wrong when really the recipe is just accounting for a glass 9 by 13. So I always recommend a glass 9 by 13. We also have a baking sheet here I have about three of them in varying sizes, but if you're only going to get one I'm going to say get the biggest one because you can always just put one thing on there and pop it in the oven. So I always have a large baking sheet you can use it for cookies you can use it for chicken you can use it for just about anything you want to put in the oven. So these are the basic kitchen utensils that I think every home chef should own and most of these you'll see are required for the recipes on this web application."} />

            Crack an Egg

            <Video videoString={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FS62T5OC4zU?si=jD1zYov7sSffDkif"} videoTranscript={"To crack an egg, we're going to want to make sure that we have something to put our cracked egg into. This case I'm going to be using a bowl. You're going to also want something with a little bit of a lip and we'll use that for actually cracking the egg. Some people will do it on the table but that doesn't give you as nice a crack, and it's harder to peel apart. So I'm going to be using a bowl. So you'll go ahead you'll grab one of your eggs you'll lightly tap it on the side of the bowl until you can hear it crack. You don't want to go all the way through, so less pressure is going to be a bit better. Once you go through you'll see a little bit comes out; that's totally okay. You'll hold the egg, and then you'll just peel apart there you go."} />

            <Video videoString={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/HmYQl6Cdb-Q?si=rAJAcctMDDCxn7Qx"} videoTranscript={"To separate an egg, you're going to want to have two bowls- one that will contain your white and one that will contain the yolk. A lot of recipes will require one or the other, so it's important to learn how to separate them. You're going to start by cracking your egg over the bowl that you want to keep the egg white in. I have a different egg in here but just ignore that for now. You're going to crack your egg like I showed you before. So light pressure until you can just feel a crack, and then you're going to try and peel apart as as gently as you can. Our goal is to keep the egg yolk in the bottom half of the shell and you'll see that that egg white comes spilling out. I'm then going to use both halves of the egg and gently transfer the yolk from one to the other, and you see all the egg white just comes dripping out. Once you get most of it you're good to put your egg yolk in your other bowl."} />

            Peel an Onion

            <Video videoString={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmoTSigwONE?si=2vVJdP06d6yQoXoV"} videoTranscript={"In this video I'm going to be showing you how to peel the skin off of your onion so that we can get to the part that we actually want to eat. With your chef knife, we're going to cut just above the root, and just above the other side as well to get rid of these ends. This will make peeling the onion a lot easier. Let's go ahead cut all the way through, and then do it again on the other side. As you can see we're getting a lot of this papery material coming off. This is stuff that we definitely don't want to eat. So then the next step you're going to peel off that outer layer of skin should come off. If it doesn't it'll just take a little bit of time. You'll also notice that there are some layers that aren't exactly this papery color, but they'll be very thin and sort of greenish. It's okay to peel those off as well. Just want to make sure that we're getting all of this papery skin off and then your onion is peeled and ready to go."} />

            Dice an Onion

            <Video videoString={"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kGewubDQYvM?si=-b_GYQ9UN0Hmm15S"} videoTranscript={"After your onion is peeled, the next thing you're going to want to do is dice your onion. The first step you want to hold it with the root ends facing toward you. We're going to cut the onion in half this will make things easier for our next step. Don't worry if you cry a little bit - I'm definitely going to. Next you're going to place your onion with the flat side down so that you can see the root of the onion. We're going to cut about 3/4ths of the way through, and we're going to make little slits into our onion. And this will make it really easy for us to go back and dice. As you can see I'm cutting them about a 1/2 an inch apart, but I'm leaving that end piece I'm not going all the way through because that's what's going to make the dicing easy. And remember doesn't have to be perfect. Ao you're taking the tip of your knife, going that 3/4 length, and then putting pressure down. Then you're going to turn your onion sideways and we're going to go about the same distance apart, and we're going to cut through and this should leave us with some really nice diced onion. All right and once you get to the part that's a little bit thin, we don't want to cut our fingers so I'm going to turn it on its side again, so that I have a little bit more room and I'm just going to go back through and cut it from the top. And there you go. Once you spread them apart you'll have some perfectly nice diced onion, and you'll spread it apart while you're cooking so you don't have to do it. I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes, but that is one of the easiest ways to dice an onion, so you'll go ahead and you'll do it with the other half as well."} />
